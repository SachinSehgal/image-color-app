####### Soltion of creating image with Unique colors #######

1. As our image dimension is of 256 x 128, so total colours reqired are 32768
2. and we have to create colors in multiple of 8 in order to get 32 unique numbers (256 / 8 = 32)
3. so, generated 32 unique numbers using a while loop
4. once I have 32 unique numbers, I generated uniquew numbers in a set of 3, 
   as I need colors in RGB mode (as 32x32x32 = 32768)
5. Once I have colors I set them in Canavas
6. Colors generation happening on first time page load and on clicking of button too
   each time button is clicked, new set of unique numbers get generated and based on that we generate new colors
